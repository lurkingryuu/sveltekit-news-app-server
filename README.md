# News Forum App server

## How to Run Locally?

### Node.js

- Clone the repository
- Navigate to the root directory
- Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies
- Run `npm run dev` to start the backend server
- The api is now available at `0.0.0.0:3000/api`

## Features Left to Implement

1. Newsletter Service
- The backend successfully handles subscription and unsubscription operations, but the mailing service is not functional, preventing the implementation of the newsletter subscription service.
